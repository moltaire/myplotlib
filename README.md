# myplotlib

My custom matplotlib stuff. I got inspired to do this by [this blogpost](https://colcarroll.github.io/yourplotlib/) and this [PyData Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV4Y75ZUDJA).

Work in progress.

Currently included:

## Violin plot

## Scatter plot

## Linear Model plot

## Utilities

### Subplot labelling

### Annotation
